Generic Algorithms:
====================
- The Java collections framework provides various algorithms that can be used to manipulate 
  elements stored in data structures.
- Algorithms in Java are static methods that can be used to perform various operations on 
  collections.

1. Sorting using sort()
   The sort() method provided by the collections framework is used to sort elements. 
   The sorting occurs in natural order (ascending order). However, we can customize the sorting order of the sort() method using the Comparator interface.

2. Shuffling Using shuffle()
   The shuffle() method of the Java collections framework is used to destroy any kind of order present in the data structure. 
   It does just the opposite of the sorting.
   When we run the program, the shuffle() method will return a random output.
   The shuffling algorithm is mainly used in games where we want random output.

3. Routine Data Manipulation
   In Java, the collections framework provides different methods that can be used to manipulate data.
    reverse() - reverses the order of elements
    fill() - replace every element in a collection with the specified value
    copy() - creates a copy of elements from the specified source to destination
    swap() - swaps the position of two elements in a collection
    addAll() - adds all the elements of a collection to other collection

4. Searching Using binarySearch()
   The binarySearch() method of the Java collections framework searches for the specified element.
   It returns the position of the element in the specified collections.

5. Composition
    frequency() - returns the count of the number of times an element is present in the collection
    disjoint() - checks if two collections contain some common element.

6. Finding Extreme Values
   The min() and max() methods of the Java collections framework are used to find the minimum and the maximum elements, respectively.
