Polymorphism:
===============
Having many forms:
Polymorphism is an important concept in Object-Oriented Programming. It simply means more than one form.
i.e the same entity(method or operator or object) can perform different operations in different scenarios.

Why Polymorphism?
=================
It helps us create consistent code.
Removes redudancy
Btw --> print() method is an example of Polymorphism. It is used to print values of different types
        like char, int, string, arrays, etc

We can achieve Polymorphism in Java using:
==========================================
1. Method Overridding  --  during inheritance
    - using a method with the same name adn definition in the superclass and subclasses
    - The method will perform one operation in the superclass and another operation in the subclass
    <Note> : The method  that is called is determined during the execution of the program. Hence, 
             method overridding is a `run-time polymorphism`

2. Method Overloading
    - using the same name for a method but, with different parameter types, number of parameters of both.

3. Operator Overloading
