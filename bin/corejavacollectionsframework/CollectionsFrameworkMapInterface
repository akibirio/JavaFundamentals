Map Interface:
==============
- It's an Interface of the collections framework.
- A map is a collection of key, value pairs.
- Keys cannot be duplicates
- Each key can map to at most one value.

Classes of Map interfaces:
==========================
We cannot create objects from Map because its an Interface. Instead, inorder to use Map functionalities, we use classes that implements Map interface.
    - HashTable
    - HashMap  --> LinkedHashMap
    - SortedMap ---> NavigableMap --> TreeMap

- HashTable is synchronised. Good for multi-threaded apps. It's slow. Null Not allowed.
- HashMap -- Null Allowed. Synchronised and slow.
- LinkedHashMap - doubly LinkedList implementation & its slow & needs more memory space. Null Not
  allowed. 
- TreeMap of SortedMap is sorted and nulls arnt allowed.
