Java Interface:
================
Java interface is fully an abstract class.
It cannot be used to create objects.
It only defines abstract methods. It includes Methods without a body.
Java interfaces are implemented by other classes. We use implements keyword to implement an interface.

One Interface can extend another interface using the extends keyword.
You can extend several interfaces using a comma delimeter

default Methods:
================
in Java 8 onwards, we can add methods with implementation inside an interface. 
The methods are called default Methods.
Are declared using default keyword.

Advantages of Interfaces in java:
===================================
1. Similar to abstract classes, they help us to achieve abstraction in Java
2. Interfaces provide specifications that a class (which implements it) must follow.
3. Used to achieve multiple inheritance in java, when many interfaces are implemented by a class.
